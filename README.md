# Bank-Churned-Dashboard
Excited to share my recent data analysis project where I transformed raw data into actionable insights using Microsoft Excel! ðŸ“Š
I created  interactive dashboards for Bank insights
Bank Churn Dashboard:

1. In the Bank churn project firstly I have represented Average account Balance for each gender by countries, Here I used stacked bar chart and added a slicer churn values (1, 0) i.e. Boolean value as mention in data where 1 means churned and 0 means not churned.
2. In second graph I represented churned rated by product and services used by customers for each geographic location slicer , For this I used Line chart.
3. In third case I derived that How many active and non-active customers who having credit cards which used again Boolean values for true and false for gender male and female by slicer, I visualize it by clustered chart.
4. In fourth graph I can find Average credit scores of customers by their different tenure and adding a slicer of Age variable to check and make the appropriate decision , I used custom combination chart to represent it.
5. At the Bottom of our dashboard I have added a segment for churn data of customer by selection their customer id's which can be selected by clicking on dropdown list ðŸ‘†.

   
At finally , I have done some formatting in cells , slicer and graphs to looks more attractive.


Leveraging Excel's powerful tools, I was able to:

1.Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2.Perform various statistical calculations and analyses.
3.Create visually appealing and informative dashboards.

This project has strengthened my skills in data analysis and visualization. Looking forward to applying these techniques to future projects and contributing to data-driven decision-making.
